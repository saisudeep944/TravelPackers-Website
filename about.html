    <div>
        <h3 style="color: aliceblue;letter-spacing: 0.1rem;">Travelpackers was born through the life experiences of two friends, Riq Lima and Eric Faria. Riq, is an economist who left his job as an investment banker to travel the world for 4 years with little money, but a creative mind. Eric, a certified accountant, initially travelled to the USA to learn English, but ended up staying for nearly four years. His first two years were spent helping out at USA Hostels in San Diego, as a receptionist, a housekeeper and a tourist guide by exchanging his skills for accommodation. He then helped to found International Travellers House, a hostel chain located in California and whose staff was made up entirely of volunteers. Worldpackers is a platform for travelers and hosts, made by those who live and love travel!</h3>
